Cut the @iceberg lettuce{1%crop // Hand shredded in 4x4cm pieces} in half and remove the stem. Shred the leaves in about 4x4cm pieces. Prepare all other ingredients. Wash the lettuce with cold water and drain with a salad spinner (or coliander). Smash the @ginger{1%thumb // Sliced} slices with a flat of a knife so the juices come out easier.
Make the sauce: combine @light soy sauce{2%tsp}, @oyster sauce{2%tbsp}, @sesame oil{1%tsp}, @ground white pepper{1%tsp}, @sugar{1%tsp}, @salt{Â¼%tsp} in a bowl and stir. Set aside. 
Add @vegetable oil{2tbsp // or sunflower oil} and ginger to a cold wok. Turn to medium heat and stir the slices while the oil heats up so the aroma infuses the oil. When the oil is hot (20-30 seconds), turn the heat to high and add @garlic{4%cloves // minced}. Immediately after, add the lettuce. Stir fry while scooping for 20 seconds so the oil coats all lettuce. Add the sauce and mix well.
Keep frying until about half the lettuce starts the wilting process (30-60 seconds). Be careful not to overcook; keep a balance between the lettuce still having a bite and being cooked. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
