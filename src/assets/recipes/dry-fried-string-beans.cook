Wash the @green beans{500%gr // top & bottom removed, halved} and pat them dry with a kitchen towel. Heat @vegetable oil{¼ cup // or sunflower oil} in a #wok over medium high heat. Fry the beans in one layer (requires two batches). They're done once they appear wrinkled and slightly scorched, after about 5 minutes. Use a #strainer to remove the beans and set aside.
Turn off the heat and scoop the oil out of the pan, except for 1 tbsp. Turn the heat to low, and add the @Sichuan peppercorns{2 tsp}, @ginger{1 tsp // minced}, @garlic{3 cloves // minced} and @dried red chilies{3 // deseeded and sliced}. Stir-fry for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
Next, add in the @ground pork or chicken{125 gr // or vegetarian alternative} and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry quickly to break up the pork until the meat is browned slightly.
Add in the fried green beans, @Shao Hsing wine{1 tbsp}, @light soy sauce{1 tbsp}, @dark soy sauce{¼ tsp}, and @sugar{¼ tsp}. Toss everything well, and add @salt{to taste}. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
