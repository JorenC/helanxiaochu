Cut the @spinach{500%gr // cut into 4cm long strips}, @garlic{2%cloves // minced} and @red chili{1 // Optional, sliced} (if using). 
Beat the @eggs{2} and add 1 tsp @salt{2%tsp} and fry them into scrambled eggs. Take them out and put them aside. Combine 1 tsp salt, @sugar{1%tsp}, @oyster sauce{2%tsp}, @cornstarch{1%tsp}, @water{4%tbsp} in a bowl.
Boil water and add @vegetable oil{1%tbsp // or sunflower oil}. Blanche the spinach for 1 minute until it starts to wilt. Remove it and put it in a bowl with cold water to stop the cooking and preserve colour (you might need two batches). Take out the spinach and with your hands, squeeze out the water.
On a medium fire, heat oil and add the garlic and red pepper. Fry until aroma comes out, then add the spinach and @Shao Hsing wine{1%tsp}. Stir well, then add the egg and fry for a minute. Add the sauce, and fry for another minute. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
