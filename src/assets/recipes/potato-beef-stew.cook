Cut the @chuck roast beef{1%kg // cut in bite-sized pieces} and put in a large pan. Fill with water until it just covers the beef. Boil over medium heat for 15 minutes.
While boiling the beef, remove the broth skin from the top of the water and discard. Repeat until the wateris clear. Prepare the other ingredients.
Add the @Shao Hsing wine{¼%cup}, @dried red chilies{6 // whole}, @spring onions{3%stalks // cut in 8cm lengths}, @bay leaves{6}, @star anise{2}, @cinnamon sticks{2}, @sugar{1%tbsp} and @ground black pepper{½%tsp}. Cover the pan and let is simmer for 45 minutes.
Add @light soy sauce{¼%cup}, @dark soy sauce{1%tbsp} and @salt{½%tsp}. Stir wel.
Remove the cover and simmer uncovered for another 1 hour and 30 minutes (1 hour if in a rush). The beef should be tender, but not fall apart.
Add the @carrot{3 // cut in bite-sized pieces} and @potatoes{4%medium // cut in bite-sized pieces}, and let simmer uncovered for another 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender (If not enough liquid, add a bit of water - but be conservative as this dilutes the taste). Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
