Wash and remove the tops and bottoms of the @green beans{500%gr // Top and bottom removed}. Prepare all other ingredients. Heat 2 tablespoons @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the @garlic{4%cloves // sliced} and fry until the aroma comes out. (To reduce calories, pre-boil the beans and use 1 tbsp oil. That way, only a quick stir fry suffices in step 2.
Add the green beans and spread them out. Let them cook for 20 seconds, then stir and repeat the spreading step several times until the green beans are slightly wilted and cooked through. It will take about 5 minutes to cook them this way. Turn the heat down if needed to stop burning.
Add the @olive vegetable{2%tbsp} and mix it. Stir fry for one minute. Add the @sugar{2%tsp} and @oyster sauce{1%tbsp} and mix thoroughly.
If you like spicy, add the @red chili{¼%piece // sliced, optional} as a kicker and keep frying for 30 seconds. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
