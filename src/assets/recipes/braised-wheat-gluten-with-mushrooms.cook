>> remark: Dried wheat gluten, shii-take, ear mushroom and lily flower and raw skinned peanuts can be bought at Amazing Oriental. If you can't find wheat gluten (called Kao fu), use Soya Meat as alternative. 
Hydrate the @dried wheat gluten (kao fu){250%gr // Rehydrated, cut into cubes}, @dried shii-take mushrooms{12 // rehydrated}, @dried wood ear mushrooms{½%cup // rehydrated} and @dried lily flower{½%cup // rehydrated} in large bowls of water and leave them for at least an hour; the more the better. After rehydrating, rinse all under running water and drain. Cut the wheat gluten in 2x2 cm cubes.
Heat @vegetable oil{3 tbsp // or sunflower oil} and fry the @ginger{3%slices // sliced} for 30 seconds. Add the wheat gluten and stir-fry until slightly browned (about 2 minutes). 
Add the shii-take and wood ear mushroom, lily flower and @raw peanuts{¼%cup // or roasted, unsalted peanuts}. Mix well. Add the @Shao Hsing wine{3%tsp}, @light soy sauce{3%tbsp}, @dark soy sauce{1%tbsp}, @sugar{3%tsp} and @water{3%cups}. Stir well and bring to a boil.
Turn the heat to low, cover the pan, and let everything simmar for about 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes to prevent sticking. Serve hot or cold with steamed rice and other dishes. (This is usually served hot but works as appetizer or side dish).
