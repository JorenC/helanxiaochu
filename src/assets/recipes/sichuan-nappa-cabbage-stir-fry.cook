Only use the stems of the @Chinese cabbage{450%gr // Stems only, sliced at an angle} as they're drier; cut the leaves and leave them for another dish. Slices the stems on a 45 degree angle, so that there's enough surface to absorb the sauce later. Prepare all other ingredients.
In a bowl, mix the @light soy sauce{4%tsp}, @Chinkiang vinegar{1%tbsp}, @sugar{2%tbsp} and @oyster sauce{1%tbsp} until the sugar is dissolved. In another bowl, dissolve the @cornstarch{Â½%tbsp}, in 1 tbsp @water{1%tbsp} to make a slurry. Set aside.
Heat @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok over medium low heat. Add the @garlic{4%cloves // smashed and sliced}, @dried red chilies{3-6 // deseeded and sliced}, and @spring onions{1 // sliced} and cook for 1 minute. Add the cabbage and turn the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. 
Add the prepared sauce and cook for another minute. Season with @salt{to taste} to taste. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and stir-fry for one more minute, until the sauce has thickened. Serve with steamed white rice and other dishes.
