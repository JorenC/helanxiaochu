Cut the @lamb shoulder{450%gr // cut in bite-sized pieces} in bite-sized pieces. Combine with @Shao Hsing wine{1%tbsp}, @light soy sauce{1%tbsp}, @salt{½%tsp}. Marinate for 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge). Prepare the rest of the ingredients. When ready to cook, drain the liquid and add @cornstarch{4%tsp} while stirring 1 tsbp at a time until well coated.
Combine @cumin powder{2%tbsp}, @chili flakes{2%tsp}, @sugar{½%tsp} and @Sichuan pepper powder{½%tsp // ground sichuan peppers} in a bowl. Heat a wok over high-medium heat, then add 3 tbsp @vegetable oil{4%tbsp // or sunflower oil}. Add the lamb pieces and spread them out so they don't overlap. Cook until golden (about 1 minute), then flip each piece around. Cook until the inside is still slighty pink (30-40 seconds). Transfer the lamb to a plate.
Add 1 tbsp vegetable oil to the wok and add the @dried red chilies{15 // whole}, @ginger{1%thumb, minced} and @garlic{5%cloves // minced}. Stir-fry until fragrant. Add the @white onion{1%(small) // coursely diced} and stir fry for about 1 minute until the onion starts to turn tender.
Add back the lamb and sprinkle the spice mix over. Stir to coat the lamb. Try a piece of lamb to check and add @salt{to taste} to taste. Remove the pan and add @coriander{3%stems // sliced} and garnish with @toasted sesame seeds{1%tsp // garnish, optional} if using. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
