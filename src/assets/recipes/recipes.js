    ">> preparation: 35 minutes\n>> cook time: 20 minutes\n>> servings: 4\n>> remark: Don't use western vermicelli, but get vermicelli (or glass) noodles from any Asian grocery store (e.g. Lungkow Vermicelli in Amazing Oriental)\nWash the @green beans{500%gr // top & bottom removed, halved} and pat them dry with a kitchen towel. Heat @vegetable oil{¼ cup // or sunflower oil} in a #wok over medium high heat. Fry the beans in one layer (requires two batches). They're done once they appear wrinkled and slightly scorched, after about 5 minutes. Use a #strainer to remove the beans and set aside.\nTurn off the heat and scoop the oil out of the pan, except for 1 tbsp. Turn the heat to low, and add the @sichuan peppercorns{2 tsp}, @ginger{1 tsp // minced}, @garlic{3 cloves // minced} and @dried red chilies{3 // deseeded and sliced}. Stir-fry for about 1 minute, until fragrant.\nNext, add in the @ground pork or chicken{125 gr // or vegetarian alternative} and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry quickly to break up the pork until the meat is browned slightly.\nAdd in the fried green beans, @Shiao Hsing wine{1 tbsp}, @light soy sauce{1 tbsp}, @dark soy sauce{¼ tsp}, and @sugar{¼ tsp}. Toss everything well, and add @salt{to taste}. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.",

    ">> preparation: 5 minutes\n>> dehydration: 10 minutes\n>> servings: 4\nRemove the @cucumber{2} top and bottom. Place it on a board, and hit it with the side of a big knife so it cracks open. Make sure to hit it hard enough so it cracks open in one go instead of multiple soft hits, or it will get smushy. \nCut the cracked cucumber cross-wise into bite sized pieces.\nPut the cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle it with @salt{1 tbsp}. Let it sit for 10 minutes and drain the extracted water. You can skip this step if in a hurry, in that case use only half of the salt. \nAdd @light soy sauce{1 tbsp}, @Chinkiang vinegar{½ tbps}, @sesame oil{1 tsp}, @garlic{3 cloves // minced}, @sugar{½ tsp}, @hot chili oil{1½ tbsp // to taste} and @Sichuan pepper oil{1 tsp // to taste, optional} (if using) in a bowl and stir well so the flavour is evenly distributed. Serve with steamed white rice and other dishes.",
