Crack the @eggs{4%eggs // beaten} in a bowl and add 1 tbsp @light soy sauce{1 + 1%tbsp}. Beat the eggs thoroughly. Prepare all other ingredients.
Heat 1 tbsp @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok over medium-high heat until it smokes. Add the eggs and fry until the bottom is done, but the top is still raw (about 30 seconds). Scramble the eggs while chopping them into bite-sized pieces, until just cooked. Transfer eggs to a plate and set aside. 
Add 1 more tsbp of oil, turn heat to high and add @garlic{2%cloves // sliced} and @spring onions{1%stalk // sliced, green and whites separated} whites. Stir fry until fragrance comes out. Add @tomatoes{4-5 // sliced in bite-sized wedges} and immediately add 1 tbsp light soy sauce, @sesame oil{1%tsp}, @sugar{2%tsp} and @chicken powder{1Â½%tsp}. Stir and cook the tomatoes in their own liquid until the skin starts to soften.
Add the cooked egg and stir to evenly distribute the flavour. Garnish with spring onion greens and serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
