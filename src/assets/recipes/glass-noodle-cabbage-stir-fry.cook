>> remark: Don't use Western vermicelli, but get vermicelli (or glass noodles) from any Asian grocery store (e.g. Lungkow Vermicelli in Amazing Oriental).
Soak the @vermicelli{50%gr // soaked for 10 minutes} until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and then set them aside (still in the soaking water). Slice the @oxheart cabbage{500%gr // sliced in thin strips} into 1-2 cm thick strips and prepare the rest of the ingredients. 
Beat the @eggs{2} along with the @salt{¼%tsp} and 1 tsp @Shao Hsing wine{1 tbsp}. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add @vegetable oil{1%tbsp // or sunflower oil} and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until they're almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take them out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in the wok over medium heat. Add @dried red chilies{3-5 // cut in half}, @garlic{2%cloves // sliced}, and @spring onions{1%stalk // sliced}. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the soaking noodles out of the water, and add them to the cabbage (easiest is to do this by hand). Add the cooked egg and add 1 tbsp Shao Hsing wine. Stir fry, and then add @oyster sauce{1%tsp}, @light soy sauce{1%tsp}, @sugar{½%tsp} and @white pepper{½%tsp}. Stir well and stir-fry for 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender. Serve hot with steamed rice and other dishes.
