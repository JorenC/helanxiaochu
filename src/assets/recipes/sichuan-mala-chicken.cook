Cut the @chicken thigh filet{450%gr // Cut into bite-sized pieces} and add it to a bowl with @cornstarch{1%tsp}, @salt{¾%tsp}, 1 tbsp @vegetable oil{5%tbsp // or sunflower oil}, 2 tsp @Shao Hsing wine{2%tsp} and @dark soy sauce{1%tsp}. Mix well. Cover and put it in the fridge for at least 60 minutes (the more the better). 
Prepare the rest of the ingredients. Heat 4 tbsp oil over high heat. Add the chicken in a single layer and let it fry (do not move it) until there is a good, crisp crust on the bottom. After this, stir and fry until brown and crisp on all sides. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
There should be oil left. Add more if needed. Heat the wok to medium heat, then add the @Sichuan peppercorns{2%tbsp}. Fry for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.  Add the @ginger{2%tbsp // Cut into thin long strips} and @garlic{5%cloves // Sliced} and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the @dried red chilies{1%cup // cut in half} and cook for another minute. Turn the heat to high and add the chicken, @Shao Hsing wine{1%tsp}, @sugar{½%tsp} and @spring onions{1%stalk // sliced}. 
Continue to fry until all liquid in the wok has evaporated. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
