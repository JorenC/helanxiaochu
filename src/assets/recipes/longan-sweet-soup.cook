Rinse @dried snow fungus{40%gr // cut in smaller pieces}, @dried red dates{10}, @dried longan{20%gr}, @ginkgo nuts{20} and @dried lotus seeds{30 // optional}. Remove pits from the dates and black seeds from lotus seeds. Soak everything for a couple of hours (30 minutes in boiled water if in a rush).
Ensure the snow fungus is soft and plump. Take it out and cut it in smaller pieces. Trim and discard the yellowish crusty bottom part. 
Boil water in a large pot. Add all ingredients except for the sugar. Simmer with lid on low heat for 20 minutes (leave a gap to prevent boiling over).
Check if all ingredients have softended. If not, simmer longer. Add @rock sugar{to taste // or white sugar} and stir until it melts. Taste to check sweetness. Serve hot or cold (can be kept 3 days in the fridge).
