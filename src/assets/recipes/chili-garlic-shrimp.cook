De-vein the tiger prawns. Combine the @tiger prawns{500%gr // head removed} and @Shao Hsing wine{2%tsp} in a bowl. Add @salt{½%tsp} and mix. Set aside for 10 minutes. Combine @hot chili oil{¼%cup // or chili garlic sauce}, @brown sugar{2%tbps} and @light soy sauce{1%tbsp} in a different cup and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside. Prepare all other ingredients.
Heat 4 tbsp @vegetable oil{4 tbsp + 1½ tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok until hot. Add the shrimp one-by-one until the pan bottom is covered (you need two batches). Cook the shrimp without stirring them until the bottom starts browning (2-3 mins). Flip each to the other side (another 2-3 mins). When done, transfer shrimp to a plate.
Wipe the wok with a paper towel to remove residue. Add the 1½ tbsp oil over medium heat. Add @ginger{2%tbsp // minced} and stir until fragrant. Add the sauce to the pan. Cook until the sauce becomes sticky and glossy (20-30 seconds).
Set heat to low and return the shrimp to the pan, tossing to coat thoroughly. Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
