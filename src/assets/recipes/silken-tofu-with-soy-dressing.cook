Peel the front cover off the @silken tofu{300%gr}. Place a few layers of kitchen towel on top of the box and flip it around completely. Leave it to drain. Prepare all ingredients. 
Add @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok on low heat and immediately add half the @spring onions{3 // finely chopped} and @garlic{3%cloves // minced}. Stir regularly while the aromatics heat up until they start turning golden. When that happens, immediately remove the pan from the heat (When turning golden, the aromatics will very quickly turn black and become bitter). 
Add the @chili flakes{1%tsp}, @light soy sauce{2%tbsp}, @sugar{Â½%tsp} and @Chinkiang vinegar{1%tsp}. Mix well. Flip over the tofu and carefully remove the kitchen paper, replacing it with an upside down serving plate. Flip it over gently and lift the box. (Cut the box to prevent a vacuum).
Pour the sauce over the tofu. Garnish with leftover spring onions and @sesame seeds{2%tsp // toasted, optional garnish}. Serve with steamed white rice and other dishes.
