Wash and dry the vegetables with a paper towel. Cut @potato{1%large // peeled, cut in bite-sized pieces} and @eggplant{1 // cut in bite-sized pieces} in triangular bite-sized pieces. Prepare the other ingredients. Mix the @cornstarch{1½%tbsp} and @water{3%tbsp} in a bowl and set aside. (Use the Chinese rolling technique; cut off a bite sized piece diagonally, roll the vegetable about 90 degrees along the cutting surface, slice again, and repeat).
Heat @vegetable oil{1%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok over medium heat. Add the potato and brown lightly for about 8 minutes until cooked through. Stir occasionally to avoid burning. Add the @bell pepper{1 // cut into bite-sized pieces}, and stir-fry for another minute. Transfer everything to a dish and set aside.
There should be oil left in the wok; otherwise, add some. Add the eggplant and brown slightly; Spread the eggplant pieces into a single layer, cover the lid for a minute, uncover, stir the eggplant to avoid burning, then repeat. Do this 2-3 times until the eggplant is cooked through. Transfer to a dish.
Add oil if the wok is very dry. Add @garlic{3%cloves // minced} and cook for a few seconds. Add all vegetables back in the wok. Add @Shao Hsing wine{1%tbsp}, @light soy sauce{2%tsbp}, @sugar{1%tsp}, @white pepper{½%tsp}, and @sesame oil{1%tsp}. Stir well. Turn up the heat. Stir and add the cornstarch slurry and @spring onions{2%stalks // sliced}. Stir to coat the vegetables with sauce and add @salt{to taste}. Serve hot with steamed rice and other dishes.
