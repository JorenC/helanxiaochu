>> remark: Okra is available in a lot of toko's. Otherwise, Amazing Oriental will have it.
Wash the @okra{300%gr // cut in 1cm slices} and cut them in 1 cm slices. Cut the @dried red chilies{4%chilies} in half. 
Add @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} in a wok over medium heat and immediately insert the @sichuan peppercorns{1%tbsp}. Wait until they start to darken and take the peppercorns out (we only use the infused oil). Add the chilies and whisk them around a few times until the aroma comes loose. 
Add the okra and quickly stir-fry for 1 minute until all the okra is covered in oil. Add the @light soy sauce{2%tbsp} and mix it well. 
Stir fry until the okra is cooked through and charred on the edges, 2-3 minutes (if the wok starts to smoke intensely, lower the heat; if you can't hear vibrant sizzling, increase it again). Serve hot with steamed white rice and other dishes.
