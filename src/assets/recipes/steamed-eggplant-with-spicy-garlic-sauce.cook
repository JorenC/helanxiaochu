Boil a big pot of water and set up a steaming station with a bamboo or stainless steel steamer (or use a colander). Trim and cut the @Chinese eggplant{400gr // cut into 5x2cm slices} and add to the steamer loosely. Steam covered for ~15 min (or until a chopstick can poke through).
Meanwhile, add @spring onions{1%stalk // thinly sliced}, @garlic{2%cloves // minced} and @ginger{2%slices} and @white sesame seeds{1%tsp} to a bowl. Heat @vegetable oil{2%tbsp // or sunflower oil} until almost smoking. Pour over the garlic mixture, let sizzle and mix. Then add @light soy sauce{2%tbsp}, @Chinkiang vinegar{1%tbsp}, @hot chili oil{2%tsp} and @sugar{2%tsp}. Mix to combine.
When eggplant is ready, arrange on serving plate and pourthe sauce. Serve hot with white steamed rice and other dishes.
